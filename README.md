## Folder structure
All scripts should be in the root of the repository. Model data goes into a folder named models. The training data is to be downloaded from Luis link and unpacked. The final data resides in a folder named real_data at the root of the repository. Result files go into the results folder. Data and model folder are not to be pushed to the repo but only exist locally, the gitignore file should take care of that.
