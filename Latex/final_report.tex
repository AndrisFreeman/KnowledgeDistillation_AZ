\section{Introduction}
In recent years deep neural networks (DNNs) have become the state-of-the-art in many application domains such as computer vision, natural language processing or game playing using reinforcement learning. These advances can partly be attributed to the availability of more specialized computing power enabling larger models with millions or, especially in the case of large language models, billions of parameters. Training or using these models therefore requires the usage of cloud services or large amounts of storage and computing resources.

With the widespread use of mobile and edge devices in every day life and commercial contexts it is natural to leverage the abilities of DNNs on these devices for a multitude of use cases such as language translation or image classification. With some applications having strict latency, privacy or connectivity requirements, preventing the usage of cloud-based services, it becomes infeasible to use such large models because of memory, computational and energy consumption limitations. This makes it critical to develop methods that are aimed at reducing size and/or inference time of models while keeping a similar performance.

This work gives an overview over the three most used compression techniques for DNNs: pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation. Due to the limited scope and length of this work, the presented approaches only represent a small fraction of the published literature and should mainly serve as an introduction to the field, stressing the main concepts for different distillation techniques.
